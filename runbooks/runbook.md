# PAC - Draft Content API

Draft content API is a microservice that provides access to draft content stored in PAC.

## Code

draft-content-api

## Primary URL

https://upp-prod-delivery-glb.upp.ft.com/__draft-content-api/

## Service Tier

Bronze

## Lifecycle Stage

Production

## Host Platform

AWS

## Architecture

Provides endpoints for saving draft content. Draft content is written in native CMS format to /drafts/nativecontent/{uuid}.
Draft content may only be read in UPP format from /drafts/content/{uuid} if the service is called internally
(because that URL is used externally by Draft Content Public Read). When used for reading the Draft Content API calls
the necessary mapper/validator to perform transformation on-demand. If draft content is not available in PAC for a document,
the Draft Content API may retrieve the most recently published version from UPP.
