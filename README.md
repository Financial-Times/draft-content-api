## Service endpoints
_What are the endpoints offered by the service_

e.g.
### GET

Using curl:

    curl http://localhost:8080/people/143ba45c-2fb3-35bc-b227-a6ed80b5c517 | json_pp`

Or using [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie):

    http GET http://localhost:8080/people/143ba45c-2fb3-35bc-b227-a6ed80b5c517

The expected response will contain information about the person, and the organisations they are connected to (via memberships).

Based on the following [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SC4Uskl-VD78y0lg5H2Gq56VCmM4OFHofZM-OvpsOFo/edit#heading=h.qjo76xuvpj83).


## Utility endpoints
_Endpoints that are there for support or testing, e.g read endpoints on the writers_

## Healthchecks
Admin endpoints are:

`/__gtg`

`/__health`

`/__build-info`

_These standard endpoints do not need to be specifically documented._

_This section *should* however explain what checks are done to determine health and gtg status._

There are several checks performed:

_e.g._
* Checks that a connection can be made to Neo4j, using the neo4j url supplied as a parameter in service startup.

## Other information
_Anything else you want to add._

_e.g. (NB: this example may be something we want to extract as it's probably common to a lot of services)_

### Logging

* The application uses [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus); the log file is initialised in [main.go](main.go).
* Logging requires an `env` app parameter, for all environments other than `local` logs are written to file.
* When running locally, logs are written to console. If you want to log locally to file, you need to pass in an env parameter that is != `local`.
* NOTE: `/__build-info` and `/__gtg` endpoints are not logged as they are called every second from varnish/vulcand and this information is not needed in logs/splunk.
